# Cloud IAM Permissions Assignment

## Overview
In this assignment, you will gain hands-on experience with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and GitHub Actions by setting up a fully functional CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy Docker images to a [Google Cloud Artifact Registry](#artifact-registry). You will also configure Workload Identity Federation to securely authenticate your GitHub Actions workflows with GCP without needing long-lived service account keys. This approach is essential for modern cloud-based CI/CD pipelines, ensuring secure and scalable authentication.

### Artifact Registry
__**Tutorial**__ --> [Create Docker Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/repositories/create-repos#create-repo-gcloud-docker)
The Artifact Registry is a fully-managed service provided by Google Cloud that allows you to store, manage, and secure container images, language packages, and other artifacts. It is a central place to house artifacts that are used in your CI/CD pipelines, such as Docker images or packages for languages like npm or Python.

For this assignment, you will be working specifically with Docker Artifact Repositories to store and retrieve Docker container images. Artifact Registry provides several key benefits, including:
- **Scalability**: Automatically scales to handle large volumes of artifacts.
- **Security**: Includes access control via IAM roles to restrict who can push or pull images.
- **Regional availability**: You can create Artifact Registries in specific GCP regions to improve latency and data sovereignty.

When you create an Artifact Registry, you choose a repository format (e.g., Docker) and specify a region. Then, your GitHub Actions workflow will push Docker images to this registry as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

### (Direct) Workload Identity Federation
__**Tutorial**__ --> [Direct Workload Identity Federation](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth?tab=readme-ov-file#preferred-direct-workload-identity-federation) - This documentation explains how to set up Workload Identity Federation for GitHub Actions. Focus on `(Preferred) Direct Workload Identity Federation` section.
Workload Identity Federation is a method for enabling secure, short-lived credentials that allow external services, such as GitHub Actions, to interact with Google Cloud resources like Artifact Registry. It eliminates the need to manage long-lived service account keys, which can pose a security risk if exposed.

With Workload Identity Federation, GitHub Actions can authenticate directly with Google Cloud using OpenID Connect (OIDC) tokens. These tokens are short-lived and are automatically managed, providing a more secure and scalable solution compared to using service account keys.

Hereâ€™s how it works in this assignment:
- **Workload Identity Pool**: You will create a pool in GCP that acts as a trusted identity provider. GitHub Actions will send OIDC tokens to GCP through this pool.
- **IAM Permissions**: You will bind the Workload Identity Pool to an appropriate IAM role that allows it to access the Artifact Registry. This ensures that your GitHub Actions workflow has permission to push Docker images to the Artifact Registry without needing to manage long-lived keys.
- **Federation Setup**: When configured correctly, GitHub Actions will automatically request OIDC tokens from GitHub and exchange them for GCP access tokens, allowing your CI/CD workflow to interact with GCP resources securely.

By the end of this assignment, you will:
- Understand how to create and configure an Artifact Registry in GCP.
- Implement Workload Identity Federation for secure access between GitHub and GCP.
- Configure IAM roles and permissions to control access to cloud resources.
- Automate Docker image builds and pushes using GitHub Actions.

## Prerequisites
- **GCP account**: You must have a valid Google Cloud Platform account with billing enabled.
- **Public GitHub repository**: Ensure you have a public GitHub repository, as GitHub Actions will need access to the workflow runners for this project.
- **Basic knowledge of Containers**: Familiarity with Docker containers, building images, and pushing them to registries.
- **Familiarity with IAM and cloud security principles**: This assignment involves configuring permissions and security settings for your GCP resources.

## Rubric

You will be graded on the following:
1. **Working Github Action Workflow**: Create a CI workflow that will build and push an image to gcr.io Container Repository
2. **Configure Direct Workload Identity Federation**: Create Workload Identity Pool that has IAM permissions to GCP Artifactory
3. **Create an Artifact Repository**: Create GCP Artifact Repository for our image
4. **IAM Permissions**: Configuring Workload Identity Federation for GitHub Actions authentication and authorize access to GCP Artifactory.

| **Criteria**                               | **Description**                                                                              | **Points** |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| **Working GitHub Action Workflow**         | The GitHub Action should successfully build a Docker image and push it to the Artifact Registry without errors. Ensure the correct region and repository are used. | 2 pt       |
| **OIDC Workload Federation Identity**      | Configure OIDC Workload Identity Federation to authenticate GitHub Actions with GCP, ensuring the correct IAM roles are assigned to the identity pool. A complete solution will use GCP service accounts and the GitHub OIDC provider without using long-lived credentials. | 5 pt       |
| **Create Artifact Registry**               | The Artifact Registry must be created in GCP using the correct repository format (docker) and in the specified region.          | 3 pt       |
| **Grant Permissions to OIDC PrincipalSet** | Grant the necessary IAM roles to the Workload Identity Federation principal, allowing the GitHub Actions workflow to push Docker images to the Artifact Registry. Correct permission setup will be verified by pushing images to the registry. | 5 pt       |

Focus on `(Preferred) Direct Workload Identity Federation` section.
- [Create Docker Artifactory](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/repositories/create-repos#create-repo-gcloud-docker) - Follow this guide to create a Docker Artifact Registry in GCP. Pay attention to the gcloud commands for creating the repository.
  - **Please omit the --kms-key and --immutable-tags --async** flags
  - ` gcloud artifacts repositories create YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME --repository-format=docker --location=[REGION] --description="some description" --project=[PROJECT ID]`
- [Artifact Registry Access Control](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/access-control) - This guide covers how to configure IAM permissions for your Artifact Registry. Ensure you understand how to grant roles to your Workload Identity Pool.
- [Github Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/quickstart) - This quickstart guide will help you set up your first GitHub Action workflow.
  - Please note that the [ci.yaml](.github/workflows/ci.yml) has a "working" solution commented out. You job is to enable the workflow with proper IAM permissions


## Submission
You will submit your GitHub project link to Canvas. Ensure that the following are included in your repository:

- **logging.json**: Exported logs of GCP activity (from the Logging service in GCP). This will show the actions performed during the creation of the registry and the setup of Workload Identity Federation.
- **metrics.csv**: Exported metrics data from Workload Identity Pools (found under IAM > Workload Identity Federation > ellipsis on graph > "View In Metrics Explorer" > Download). This will provide insight into authentication metrics for your workload identity.

You must have all your files merged to `main`. 

## Helpful commands

### List Artifact Repositories
Use this command to list all Artifact Registries in your GCP project. Replace [PROJECT ID] and [REGION] with your specific values.

```shell
 gcloud artifacts repositories list --project=[PROJECT ID] --location=[REGION]
```

### Verify Permissions on Artifact Registry
This command checks the IAM policy for your Artifact Registry. Ensure your Workload Identity Pool has the correct permissions to push Docker images.

```shell
gcloud artifacts repositories get-iam-policy [Container Registry Name] \
  --location=us-central1 \
  --project="${PROJECT_ID}"
```

### Bind Role To PrincipleSet on Artifact REgistry
```shell
gcloud artifacts repositories add-iam-policy-binding [Artifact Registry] \
  --location=[REGION] \
  --member="principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/${WORKLOAD_ID_POOL}/attribute.repository/${REPO}" \
  --role="roles/something.special" \
  --project="${PROJECT_ID}"

```
